Using shapefiles the module does not require setting up a spatial database and does not require any particular GIS. point2tent is still under early development with more functionality on the way but all functions in the master branch should be working properly.\r\n\r\n##**Usage**##\r\n\r\nIn its current state points2tent has two main functions namely tent_defs() converts a csv file to the required format and draw_tents() creates the output shapefile.\r\n\r\n    import point2tent as p2t\r\n\tdefs = p2t.tent_defs('definitions.csv')\r\n\ttentpoints = 'points.shp'\r\n\tp2t.draw_tents(tentpoints, defs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n####**tent definitions**####\r\n\r\n\r\n\ttent_defs(input_file)\r\n\r\nThe tent_defs() function requires a csv in the following format:\r\n| type | x | y | z |\r\n|------|---|---|---|\r\n| 1    | 3 | 4 | 5 |\r\nwhere x is the and z is the height of the tent.  All values should be in metres\r\nThe standard UNHCR family tent is automatically included as an option. This function will return a list of dictionaries that can be used in the draw_tents() function.\r\n\r\nFor more advanced users, complex tent/structures polygons can be constructed using a simple python dictionary formatting as follows:\r\n\r\n    {'type':'9','z':'3','def':[(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)...]}\r\n\r\nwhere  'z' is the height of the tent in metres and 'def' is a list of vertices in metres with an origin of 0,0 and starting from the bottom left and going anti-clockwise. e.g. UNHCR family tent:\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n    {'type':'99', 'z':'2.2', 'def':[(2, -2), (3.3, -0.7), (3.3, 0.7), (2, 2), (-2, 2), (-3.3, 0.7), (-3.3, -0.7), (-2, -2)]}\r\n\r\n![unhcr_vertice](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8487728/9671053/54653378-524d-11e5-92fb-2c9f9a87d5ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n####**draw tents**####\r\n\r\n\tdraw_tents(input_file, tent_defns, output_file = None)\r\n\r\nThe input shapefile requires the following columns: id, type, and angle. The input must be projected with the units in _metres_ e.g. a UTM projection. All the attributes of the input shapefile will not persist to the output so it is recommended to join tent attributes after the polygons have been created.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis example below uses the points provided by a [UNOSAT analysis of Zataari Camp in Jordan ](http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/1714?utm_source=unosat-unitar&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=maps)and  coverts the points to UNHCR family tent polygons oriented in the given block orientation:\r\n\r\n#####points#####\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8487728/9668858/33385bf0-5241-11e5-8c49-a392be9e8a1d.png\"  style =\"width: 100px;\"/>\r\n#####polygons#####\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8487728/9668871/34ff4d72-5241-11e5-9d17-c64511c2f885.png\"  style =\"width: 100px;\"/>\r\n","google":"UA-67171404-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
